## let's try our vim script out

## symlink where gimp can find it:

ls /Users/danthomas/Documents/speckling/center/scriptfu/make_spot_polygons.scm 

ln -s /Users/danthomas/Documents/speckling/center/scriptfu/make_spot_polygons.scm "/Users/danthomas/Library/Application Support/GIMP/2.8/scripts/make_spot_polygons.scm" 

$gimp -i --verbose -b '(make_spot_polygons "/Users/danthomas/Documents/speckling/demo/test_spots3.png" "mooptest")' -b '(gimp-quit 0)'

## new install not working, missing "gdb". What is this? 

brew search gdb

brew info gdb

## then had to do a bunch of certificate stuff, info here: <https://sourceware.org/gdb/wiki/BuildingOnDarwin>

## to find out where gdb lives:

type -a gdb ## its in /usr/local/bin

## but 

ls -l /usr/local/bin/gdb

## its a soft link to our homebrew cellar:

ls -l /usr/local/Cellar/gdb/8.1/bin/gdb

## not writable. I want to keep it that way. So mac wants sudo or gui password input

codesign -s gdb-cert /usr/local/Cellar/gdb/8.1/bin/gdb

## okay, did this help?

$gimp -i --verbose -b '(make_spot_polygons "/Users/danthomas/Documents/speckling/demo/test_spots3.png" "mooptest")' -b '(gimp-quit 0)'

## and then a mountain of errors from gdb, about shared library incompatibilites. 

## meh. fuck all that. The command line will not work for my setup. It's not worth the time
## to now debug gdb for my setup. Too deep for me. 

## let's try just using the console while gimp is running. Then maybe we can make a macro 
## instead of a script. 

## example file: "/Users/danthomas/Documents/speckling/demo/test_spots3.png"

    (let* (
            ;; load files, set vars
            (image (car (gimp-file-load 
                                0 
                                "/Users/danthomas/Documents/speckling/demo/test_spots3.png" 
                                "/Users/danthomas/Documents/speckling/demo/test_spots3.png") ) )
            (drawable (car (gimp-image-get-active-layer image)))
          )
            ;; do stuff
            ;;1 select black/solid regions:
            (gimp-image-select-color 
                image
                CHANNEL-OP-REPLACE
                drawable
                '(0 0 0) ;; black
            )
            ;;2 Convert selection to path
            (plug-in-sel2path
                RUN-NONINTERACTIVE
                image
                drawable
            ) 
            ;;3 save path to file
        (gimp-vectors-export-to-file
            image
            "/Users/danthomas/Documents/speckling/demo/spots_script_test.svg"
            0 ;; all vectors
        )
)

## so that works for copying and pasting to the console in GIMP.

## we need to either write a macro for running in the GUI that can handle lots of images or 
## try again with the command line.
