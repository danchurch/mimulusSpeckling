## this is to muck around with Doug's scripts and 
## see if we can use the outputs from his pipeline
## to get centeredness

## first, some work environment issues - can we do a 
## tmux/matlab/vim thing? or too much to ask from that 
## poor little propietary software package?

/Applications/MATLAB_R2017b.app/bin/matlab -nodesktop

t = 'Hello world!'

## works!

## lots of weird command names...

whos ## all vars in the workspace

clear ## just like shell

## "structure", something like a dictionary or js object:

aa.mass = 10.1

## instantiates an object and gives it the mass property.


aa.mass = 10.1; ## semicolon suppresses output

## or use struct()

bb = struct('weight', 3, 'velocity', [1, 0, 0], 'type', 'Cannonball')

## looks like single quotes work, the above didn't work with double.
## something to keep in mind with octave, which handles both. 

## okay, pretty simple stuff. Getting back to Doug's pipeline, can 
## we push a single flower through, then look at it here?

## trip to matlab desktop, use doug's script on flowers. 

## let's use:

## P442F1.JPG:

## look at it:


load('P442F1_petals.mat')

## this has a "left", "right", and "middle" field

## god, why are they using the term "field" to talk about
## methods/attributes/data-memeber

## as if this wasn't confusing enough. This isn't a damn spreadsheet. 

## I miss python. 

## Buck up. 

## let's rename these. These are upper-left, upper-right, and lower, respectively:

petals.upperLeft = Petals.left 
petals.upperRight = Petals.mid 
petals.bottom = Petals.right

class(petals.upperLeft.data)

head(petals.upperLeft.data)

which head

clc
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

size(petals.upperLeft.data) %% 138213 x 4
head(tall((petals.upperLeft.data)))
tail(tall((petals.upperLeft.data)))

size(petals.upperRight.data) %% 138213 x 4
head(tall((petals.upperRight.data)))
tail(tall((petals.upperRight.data)))

size(petals.bottom.data) %% 138213 x 4
head(tall((petals.bottom.data)))
tail(tall((petals.bottom.data)))
