Centeredness:

1 # spots entirely contained in center zone = 'spotsContainedInCenter'
2 # spots touching center zone = 'nuSpotsTouchCenter'
3 # spots mostly in center zone = 'nuSpotsMostlyInCenter'
4 # spot centroids in center zone =  "nuSpotCentroidsInCenter'
5 avg spot centroid distance to center of all spots = 'avgDist2CenterAllSpots'
6 avg spot centroid distance to center of spots in center zone (excludes edge spots) = 'avgDist2CenterCenterSpots'
7 % percent of total spot area in edge = 'propSpotsInCenter'
8 % center zone covered by spots = 'centerCoveredbySpots'
9 Spot on centroid = 'spotOnCentroid'

Edgeness:

10  # spots entirely contained in edge zone = 'nuSpotsContainedInEdge'
11  # spots touching edge zone in some way = 'nuSpotsTouchEdge'
12  % percent of total spot area in edge = 'propSpotsInEdge'
13  # spots mostly in edge zone (>50%) = 'nuSpotsMostlyInEdge'
14  % edge zone covered = 'edgeCoveredbySpots'
15  % length of real petal edge (not zone) covered = 'realEdgeSpotted'
16  avg dist of outline of spots to edge = 'avgDistSpotEdge2Edge'
17  avg dist of centroid of spots to edge = 'avgDistSpotCentroid2Edge'

Throat:

18 % throat zone covered
19 % percent of total spot area in throat = 'propSpotsInthroat'
20 # spots touching throat zone
21 # spots mostly in throat zone
22 # spots touching cut/base of throat zone

General polygon:

22  Biggest spot
23  Smallest spot?
24  Avg size
25  Number of spots
26  Spots in Distal end
27  Spots in proximal end
28  presence of distal center edge spot


## figure them out
## turn them into functions
## make a function that checks polys, tries to repair.
## (should be in our digitization polies?)
## make module that generates panda
## convert to R for melia
