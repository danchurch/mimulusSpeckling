Centeredness:

1 # spots entirely contained in center zone
2 # spots touching center zone
3 # spots mostly in center zone
4 avg distance to center of spots
5 % center zone covered
6 Spot on centroid

Edgeness:

7  # spots touching edge zone in some way = 'nuSpotsTouchEdge'
8   % percent of total spot area in edge = 'propSpotsInEdge'
9  # spots mostly in edge zone (>50%) = 'nuSpotsMostlyInEdge'
10  % edge zone covered = 'edgeCoveredbySpots'
11  % length of real petal edge (not zone) covered = 'realEdgeSpotted'
12  avg dist of outline of spots to edge = 'avgDistSpotEdge2Edge'
13  avg dist of centroid of spots to edge = 'avgDistSpotCentroid2Edge'

Throat:

14 % throat zone covered
15 # spots touching throat zone
16 # spots mostly in throat zone
17 # spots touching cut/base of throat zone

General polygon:

18  Biggest spot
19  Smallest spot?
20  Avg size
21  Number of spots
22  Spots in Distal end
23  Spots in proximal end
24  presence of distal center edge spot


## figure them out
## turn them into functions
## make a function that checks polys, tries to repair.
## (should be in our digitization polies?)
## make module that generates panda
